# Laravel Simple Login

This is a simple login project I decided to create one day when I was bored. It serves as a basic Laravel implementation with user authentication.

## Requirements

- PHP
- Composer

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd project-name
   ```
3. **Install PHP dependencies:**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
4. **Set up the environment file:**

Create a .env file from the .env.example file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
then, edit the .env file to configure your database settings.

5. **Run the migrations:**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```
6. **Run the project:**
   ```bash
   php artisan serve.
   ```
Go to the link provided in the console and enjoy! :)
